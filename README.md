# Overview

I decided to analyze the data set of the World Series of Baseball. I chose this data set because it is a large dataset that is easy to analyze and has a lot of questions that can be answered.

I found the following dta set on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/world-series-winners-and-losers
